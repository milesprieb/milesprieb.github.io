<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hello, my name is Miles Priebe, I am a M.S. student at the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/mnri"> Minnesota Research Institute</a> mentored by <a href="https://karthikdesingh.com/"> Assistant Professor Karthik Desingh</a> as part of the <a href="https://rpm-lab.github.io/"> Robotics: Perception, and Manipulation Lab.</a> 

 I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. During my B.S., I gained internship experience working as a project engineering intern for <a href="https://www.osii.com/"> Open Systems International (OSI) </a> and a robotics software engineer intern at <a href="https://www.thetorocompany.com/"> The Toro Company </a>. I also gained undergraduate research experience working as an assistant in the  <a href="https://design.umn.edu/wearable-technology-lab"> UMN Wearable Technology Lab </a>. I had large contributions to the <a href="https://smarthugs.umn.edu/"> Grand Challenges Research Project: Smart Hugs</a>, and various <a href="https://design.umn.edu/wearable-technology-lab/research/computer-mediated-compression"> Computer Mediated Compression projects</a>. 
 
 I am currently passionate about enhancing human-robot interaction through learning-based frameoworks. I am working on multiple projects focused around replicating humans' sense of touch in robots, and using tactile perception for robust robotic manipulation. My capstone project is the replication and extension of a soft visuotactile gripper developed by <a href="https://punyo.tech/"> Punyo at Toyota Robotics</a>.
