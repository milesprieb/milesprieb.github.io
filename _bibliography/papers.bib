abstract = {Compression-based haptics instrumented into soft, wearable systems have the potential to enhance/augment gaming and entertainment experiences. Here, we present a computer-mediated Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) garment capable of delivering spatially and temporally dynamic compression and thermal stimuli for the purposes of enhancing a movie-watching affective experience based on 4 different emotions: sadness, love, gratitude, fear. Preliminary findings, still pending publication, were obtained from an MTurk survey (n=53) that seek to gather how different emotions can/should be represented physically through a haptic garment. A proposed study in a virtual reality (VR) environment is also introduced as a next step to evaluate how the presence/absence of haptics changes a user's video-watching experience, including immersion, enjoyment, presence, and felt emotional intensity, evaluated through objective (biometrics) and subjective (self-report questionnaire and qualitative interview) measures.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
